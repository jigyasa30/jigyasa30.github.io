You can use the guidelines \u0026ldquo;as is\u0026rdquo; or adapt them with your own instructions: for example, other deployment options, information about your doc project's file structure, project-specific review guidelines, versioning guidelines, or any other information your users might find useful when updating your site. Kubeflow has a great example.\nDon't forget to link to your own doc repo rather than our example site! Also make sure users can find these guidelines from your doc repo README: either add them there and link to them from this page, add them here and link to them from the README, or include them in both locations.\n\rWe use Hugo to format and generate our website, the Docsy theme for styling and site structure, and Netlify to manage the deployment of the site. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nQuick start with Netlify Here's a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you're familiar with the GitHub workflow and you're happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\n Fork the Goldydocs repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you're not yet ready for a review, add \u0026ldquo;WIP\u0026rdquo; to the PR name to indicate it's a work in progress. (Don't add the Hugo property \u0026ldquo;draft = true\u0026rdquo; to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.) Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it's ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of \u0026ldquo;Deploy preview ready\u0026rdquo; to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you're happy with the content. When you're ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any \u0026ldquo;WIP\u0026rdquo; markers.  Updating a single page If you've just spotted something you'd like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\n Click Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don't already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process above to make, preview, and propose your changes.  Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\n  Follow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You'll need at least Hugo version 0.45 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS.\n  Fork the Goldydocs repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone. Don’t forget to use --recurse-submodules or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git\r  Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you're serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\n  Continue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\n  Creating an issue If you've found a problem in the docs, but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Goldydocs repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nUseful resources  [Docsy user guide](wherever it goes): All about Docsy, including how it manages navigation, look and feel, and multi-language support.

It assumes you have a working Grafana server up and running. If not please read the installation guide.\nLogging in for the first time To run Grafana open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/. 3000 is the default HTTP port that Grafana listens to if you haven’t configured a different port.\nThere you will see the login page. Default username is admin and default password is admin. When you log in for the first time you will be asked to change your password. We strongly encourage you to follow Grafana’s best practices and change the default administrator password. You can later go to user preferences and change your user name.\nHow to add a data source Before you create your first dashboard you need to add your data source.\nFirst move your cursor to the cog on the side menu which will show you the configuration menu. If the side menu is not visible click the Grafana icon in the upper left corner. The first item on the configuration menu is data sources, click on that and you’ll be taken to the data sources page where you can add and edit data sources. You can also simply click the cog.\nClick Add data source and you will come to the settings page of your new data source.\nFirst, give the data source a Name and then select which Type of data source you’ll want to create, see [Supported data sources]\nAfter you have configured your data source you are ready to save and test.\nBeginner guides Watch the 10min beginners guide to building dashboards to get a quick intro to setting up Dashboards and Panels.\nBasic concepts Read the Basic Concepts document to get a crash course in key Grafana concepts.\nTop header Let’s start with creating a new Dashboard.

Please see the building from source guide for more information.\nHardware requirements Grafana does not use a lot of resources and is very lightweight in use of memory and CPU. Minimum recommendation is 255mb of memory and 1 CPU.\nDepending on what features are being used and to what extent the requirements varies. Features that consume and requires more resources:\n Server side rendering of images Alerting Data source proxy  Database Grafana requires a database to store its configuration data, e.g. users, data sources and dashboards. The exact requirements depend on the size of the Grafana installation (e.g. the number of users, data sources, dashboards, features in use etc).\nGrafana supports the following databases:\n SQLite MySQL PostgreSQL  Per default Grafana ships with and uses SQLite, which is an embedded database stored on disk in Grafana’s installation location.\nSupported web browsers Grafana is supported in the current version of the following browsers. Older versions of these browsers might not be supported, so you should always upgrade to the latest version when using Grafana.\n Chrome/Chromium Firefox Safari Microsoft Edge Internet Explorer 11 is only fully supported in Grafana versions prior v6.0.   Note: Always enable JavaScript in your browser.
