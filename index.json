Please see the building from source guide for more information.\nHardware requirements Grafana does not use a lot of resources and is very lightweight in use of memory and CPU. Minimum recommendation is 255mb of memory and 1 CPU.\nDepending on what features are being used and to what extent the requirements varies. Features that consume and requires more resources:\n Server side rendering of images Alerting Data source proxy  Database Grafana requires a database to store its configuration data, e.g. users, data sources and dashboards. The exact requirements depend on the size of the Grafana installation (e.g. the number of users, data sources, dashboards, features in use etc).\nGrafana supports the following databases:\n SQLite MySQL PostgreSQL  Per default Grafana ships with and uses SQLite, which is an embedded database stored on disk in Grafana’s installation location.\nSupported web browsers Grafana is supported in the current version of the following browsers. Older versions of these browsers might not be supported, so you should always upgrade to the latest version when using Grafana.\n Chrome/Chromium Firefox Safari Microsoft Edge Internet Explorer 11 is only fully supported in Grafana versions prior v6.0.   Note: Always enable JavaScript in your browser. Running Grafana without JavaScript enabled in the browser is not supported.\n ","excerpt":"This page includes useful information on the supported Operating Systems as well as the hardware …","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/installation/requirements/","title":"Requirements"},{"body":"Alert List Panel \nThe alert list panel allows you to display your dashboards alerts.

Grafana needs to be restarted for any configuration changes to take effect.\n Comments in .ini Files Semicolons (the ; char) are the standard way to comment out lines in a .ini file.\nA common problem is forgetting to uncomment a line in the custom.ini (or grafana.ini) file which causes the configuration option to be ignored.\nConfig file locations  Default configuration from $WORKING_DIR/conf/defaults.ini Custom configuration from $WORKING_DIR/conf/custom.ini The custom configuration file path can be overridden using the --config parameter   Note. If you have installed Grafana using the deb or rpm packages, then your configuration file is located at /etc/grafana/grafana.ini and a separate custom.ini is not used. This path is specified in the Grafana init.d script using --config file parameter.\n macOS: By default, the configuration file is located at /usr/local/etc/grafana/grafana.ini.\nUsing environment variables All options in the configuration file (listed below) can be overridden using environment variables using the syntax:\nGF_\u0026lt;SectionName\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;KeyName\u0026gt; Where the section name is the text within the brackets.
