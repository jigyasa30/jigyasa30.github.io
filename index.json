You can add freely available Grafana Wikimedia as a data source https://grafana.wikimedia.org:\n Click the Add button next to the Grafana data source.\nA pop up appears.\n  Enter values to configure the data source and click the Submit button. Further, click the Submit button on the main screen. ​ A Data Source is configured.\n  Create Alert Conditions Before creating a job, let’s walk through the steps required to create alert conditions.\n Click the Gearbox icon in the top right corner, select Alert -\u0026gt; Definitions and click the Add button.\nThe Add Alert pop up appears.\n  Setup Warning and Critical conditions.\nLet’s name it “Sharp Spike” to indicate that you want to get alert anytime a single anomalous point is detected.\nAlertLens scores each point on a scale of 0 to 100:\n 0 means not anomalous 100 means system extremely anomalous  Let’s also give a metric threshold of 10 to suppress any low-value alerts.\nFor example, a time-series may be around zero most of the times and you want to get alerted only when a much higher non-zero value occurs. Therefore, define the Warning threshold as when AlertLens score is above 50 and the Critical threshold when AlertLens score is above 70.\n  Add Job Using Grafana Add Job Flow  Open https://grafana.wikimedia.org/d/000000278/mysql-aggregated?orgId=1 in another browser tab.\nLet’s add the panel - Rows read in this dashboard as a job.\n  Click the Configuration tab and click the New Job button.\n  Select the Grafana Easy Flow workflow.\n  Select Wikimedia as the data source.\n  Select theGeneral as the folder.\n  Select MySQL Aggregated as the dashboard.\n  Scroll in the Panels and select Rows read.\n  Enter the following values in the Variables text boxes:\na. Datacenter: eqiad prometheus/ops\nb. Group: .*\nc. Shard: .*\nd. Role: .*\n  Select Sharp Spike as the alert.\n  Click Submit.\nThe following screen appears.\n  Click Save. Congrats! The First job has been created.\nNow, it will gather the data from Data Source and then perform Training and start Inference.\n  Training and Inference By default, the Training and Inference are turned off.\n Go to the Training and Inference tabs and click the Start All button.\nBy default, it goes back and gets 4 weeks of historical data (as shown in the Scheduled for column above). It should take about an hour. You can monitor the status in the Summarizer sub-tab. The whole process probably takes around an hour.\n  Alert Notifications After Training and Inference has caught up to current time, walk through the steps to set Alert Notifications:\n Go to Dashboard -\u0026gt; Alert History and see what Alerts have been triggered.\n  Click the Gearbox icon in the top right corner, select Alert -\u0026gt; Notifications.\nLet’s add a notification by Email.\n  Click the Add button and choose Type as Email.\nYou can add your Gmail account as the sender and the recipient.\nFor Example, check the following site for the settings: https://www.siteground.com/kb/google_free_smtp_server/\n  Click the Test button to make sure it works.\n  Now, go back to Alert -\u0026gt; Definitions. Edit the alert and enable the alerting method by choosing Notification as Email.\n  ","excerpt":"Let’s walk through the end-to-end functionality of AlertLens.\nLog in for the first time   Go to …","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/quick-start/","title":"Quick Start"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/quick-start/anomal_det_opt/","title":"Anomaly Detection Options"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/job-status/training/","title":"Training"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/features/dashboard/alerts_screener/","title":"Alerts Screener"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/installation/saas_model/","title":"SaaS Model"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/settings/alert-notifications/","title":"Alert Notifications"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/installation/","title":"Installation"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/settings/ad_groups/","title":"Manage AD Groups"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/job-status/inference/","title":"Inference"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/login/","title":"Login"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/settings/nodes/","title":"Manage Nodes"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/features/dashboard/","title":"Dashboard"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/features/","title":"Features"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/job-status/","title":"Job Status"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/settings/reconfigure-data-source/","title":"Reconfigure Data Source"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/settings/properties/","title":"Manage Properties"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/settings/","title":"Settings"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/settings/store/","title":"Manage Store"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/settings/timezone/","title":"Time Zone"},{"body":"Welcome to AlertLens.\n","excerpt":"Welcome to AlertLens.","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/","title":"Documentation"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/settings/reconfigure-data-source/data_source_auth_params/","title":"Data Source Authentication Parameters"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/settings/alert-notifications/channel_config/","title":"Notification Channels Configuration"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/features/time_window/","title":"Time Window"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/features/alertlens_search/","title":"Search"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/docs/login/users/","title":"Users"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://jigyasa30.github.io/index.json","title":""},{"body":"\r\r#td-cover-block-0 {\rbackground-image: url(/about/featured-background_hu376e1fbab6ce6c455a2b3aa5c258c0d9_496231_960x540_fill_q75_catmullrom_bottom.jpg);\r}\r@media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {\r#td-cover-block-0 {\rbackground-image: url(/about/featured-background_hu376e1fbab6ce6c455a2b3aa5c258c0d9_496231_1920x1080_fill_q75_catmullrom_bottom.jpg);\r}\r}\r\rAbout Goldydocs\rA sample site using the Docsy Hugo theme.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rGoldydocs is a sample site using the Docsy Hugo theme that shows what it can do and provides you with a template site structure.
