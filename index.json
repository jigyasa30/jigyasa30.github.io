As an example for the quick start, let's add a panel from one of the Grafana (open source) dashboards at https://grafana.wikimedia.org.\n  Click the Add button next to the Grafana data source.\nA pop up appears.\n  Enter values to configure the data source and click the Submit button. Further, click the Submit button on the main screen. ​\nA Data Source is configured.\n  Step 3: Create Alert Conditions Before creating a job, perform the following steps required to create alert conditions:\n  Click the Gearbox icon in the top right corner of the screen, select Alert -\u0026gt; Definitions and click the Add button.\nThe Add Alert pop up appears.\n  Setup Warning and Critical conditions.\nLet’s name it “Sharp Spike” to indicate that you want to get alert anytime a single anomalous point is detected.\nAlertLens scores each point on a scale of 0 to 100:\n 0 means not anomalous 100 means system is extremely anomalous  Let’s also give a metric threshold of 10 to suppress any low-value alerts.\nFor example, a time-series may be around zero most of the times and you want to get alerted only when a much higher non-zero value occurs. Therefore, define the Warning threshold as when AlertLens score is above 50 and the Critical threshold when AlertLens score is above 70.\n  Click the Submit button and Alert Condition is created.\n  Step 4: Add Job Using Grafana Add Job Flow   Open https://grafana.wikimedia.org/d/000000278/mysql-aggregated?orgId=1 in another browser tab.\nLet’s add the panel - Rows read in this dashboard as a job.\n  Click the Configuration tab and click the New Job button.\n  Select the Grafana Easy Flow workflow.\n  Select Wikimedia as the data source.\n  Select General as the folder.\n  Select MySQL Aggregated as the dashboard.\n  Scroll in the Panels and select Rows read.\n  Enter the following values in the Variables text boxes:\n  Datacenter: eqiad prometheus/ops\n  Group: .*\n  Shard: .*\n  Role: .*\n    Select Sharp Spike as the alert.\n  Click the Submit button.\nThe following screen appears.\n  Click Save. Congrats! The First Job has been created.\nNow, it will gather data from the Data Source and then perform Training and start Inference.\n  Step 5: Training and Inference By default, the Training and Inference are turned off.\n  Go to the Training and Inference tabs and click the Start All button.\nBy default, it goes back and gets 4 weeks of historical data (as shown in the Scheduled for column above). It takes about an hour. You can monitor the status in the Summarizer sub-tab. The whole process probably takes around an hour.\n  Step 6: Alert Notifications After Training and Inference has caught up to the current time, perform the following steps to set Alert Notifications:\n  Go to Dashboard -\u0026gt; Alert History and see what Alerts have been triggered.\n  Click the Gearbox icon in the top right corner of the screen, select Alert -\u0026gt; Notifications.\nLet’s add a notification by Email.\n  Click the Add button and choose Type as Email and enter all the email credentials. For configuration settings, refer section Email Settings.\n  Click the Test button to make sure it works.\n  Now, go back to Alert -\u0026gt; Definitions.
